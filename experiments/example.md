# Determining Chemical Integrity of Sample Vials

Start: January 12, 2022
End: March 6, 2022

## Purpose
Investigate potential issues with chemical degradation of seals in sample collection vials. Vial seals may be degraded by acetonitrile.

## Background
Initial sample collection was conducted in screw-top glass vials made by Some Bottle Company [part number 12345678](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/). Some vials returned during the pilot show evidence of structural detiroiration of the seal of the cap.<br>

<br>

In addition, GCMS chromatogram showed unexpected peaks from samples where the caps appeared degraded:

## Methods
The overall approach is to place acetonitrile in vials and test degradation over time.

### Storage conditions
Vials will be stored so ACN is in contact with seal, at xxxx temperature, etc.

### Assay
We will analyze by testing a blank... and comapre to... number of samples... timing...

### Equipment
GC-MS will be run on....

### Internal Sample IDs
Samples IDs in internal log are: NC111111, NC222222, etc.


## Results
We found that the caps were/were not elluting...

|--|--|--|--|

## Conclusion
Seal degradation was/not confirmed, and found to be time-dependent. We decided to find a different supplier for [vials](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/).
